# About

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
The actual SOLID acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers.
The intention of these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to extend.

# Single responsibility principle

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

# Open-closed Principle

Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Liskov substitution principle

Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

# Interface segregation principle

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

# Dependency Inversion principle

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
